## Screenshots

### Welcome screen

The home screen provides quick access to start a new Claude session, open a recent project, use the text editor, or access the terminal.

### Terminal

Full-featured terminal with Claude CLI integration, session tabs, and a session explorer sidebar for quick navigation between active and past sessions.

### Session history & live monitor

Browse all past sessions with filtering and search. The live monitor shows real-time activity across active sessions with an activity feed.

### File manager

Built-in file explorer with a tree view, icon grid, and a live preview pane that renders Markdown, displays code with syntax highlighting, and shows file metadata.

The session view displays Claude CLI session history with commit details and conversation previews directly in the file explorer.

### Project registry

Manage multiple projects from a single interface. Each project tracks its sessions, token usage, and cost independently.

### Hooks

Configure pre-tool and post-tool hooks to enforce safety rules, block dangerous commands, restrict file access, and customize Claude's behavior per project.

## Installation

Download the latest release for your operating system from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mgd34msu/goodvibes.sh/releases):

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| Windows | `GoodVibes-x.x.x-win-portable.zip` |
| macOS | `GoodVibes-x.x.x-mac.zip` |

## GoodVibes plugin: highly recommended

For the best experience, we recommend using GoodVibes alongside the **GoodVibes Plugin** for Claude Code. The plugin provides:

- **Directed or Autonomous Modes**: Vibecoding mode gives interactive feedback as you guide the orchestrator, Justvibes mode is full auto
- **Specialized Agents**: Pre-configured agents for frontend, backend, testing, DevOps, and more
- **Skills Library**: Reusable slash commands for common workflows (security audits, code reviews, etc.)
- **MCP Tools**: Extended tooling via Model Context Protocol for code intelligence, validation, and automation

### Quick-install plugin

Copy/Paste these into your terminal of choice. 

#### Linux / MacOS
```
curl -sL https://goodvibes.sh/install-plugin.sh | bash
```
#### Windows (Powershell)
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://goodvibes.sh/install-plugin.ps1) }"
```

#### Important security notes

Users are **STRONGLY** encouraged to download and inspect these scripts **AND** the plugin source code prior to running / installing them.
Regardless of what some may claim, as of January 31st 2026, **ALL** CLI plugins and MCP servers have unrestricted access to read, write, and execute code on your computer. 
This is true for OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic CLIs, as well as any third-party CLIs. The problem is inherent in 1) the MCP standard and 2) with plugins being granted the same rights as native tools.

## GitHub integration

GoodVibes includes GitHub integration for PR management, issue tracking, and repository operations. Authentication uses GitHub's OAuth Device Flow.

### Default configuration

Out of the box, GoodVibes uses a built-in GitHub OAuth App. This works immediately, with no setup required. Just click "Login with GitHub" in the settings.

### Custom OAuth App (optional)

For users who want full control over their GitHub integration, you can configure your own GitHub OAuth App:

1. **Create a GitHub OAuth App** at [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - See GitHub's guide: [Creating an OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
   - Use any **Application name** and **Homepage URL**
   - Set **Authorization callback URL** to: `goodvibes://oauth/callback`

2. **Configure in GoodVibes**
   - Go to **Settings -> GitHub -> Custom OAuth App -> Configure**
   - Enter your **Client ID**
   - Choose **Device Flow** (recommended) or **Authorization Code Flow**
   - If using Authorization Code Flow, also enter your **Client Secret**

### Why use a custom OAuth App?

| Built-in App | Custom App |
|--------------|------------|
| Zero configuration | Full control over permissions |
| Works immediately | Your own app in GitHub's authorized list |
| Source code available for review | Maximum security for sensitive repos |
| Shared OAuth App ID | Isolated from other GoodVibes users |

**Note:** The GoodVibes source code is fully available for review, and the built-in OAuth App cannot perform any unauthorized access. However, creating your own OAuth App provides an additional layer of security by giving you complete ownership of the GitHub integration.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher (v20+ recommended)
- **npm**: v9.0.0 or higher
- **Claude CLI**: Anthropic's Claude CLI must be installed and configured
- **Git**: Required for version control features
- **Windows/macOS/Linux**: Cross-platform support

## Linux setup

When running GoodVibes from a desktop launcher (not a terminal), your shell's PATH modifications from `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` may not be available. This can prevent GoodVibes from finding the `claude` CLI.

### Fix PATH for desktop apps

Add your local bin directory to the systemd user environment:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/environment.d
echo 'PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' > ~/.config/environment.d/path.conf
```

Then **log out and back in** for changes to take effect.

### AppImage desktop entry

To create a desktop entry for the AppImage with proper flags:

1. Download the AppImage to a permanent location (e.g., `~/.local/bin/GoodVibes.AppImage`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/GoodVibes.AppImage`
3. Create a desktop entry:

```bash
cat > ~/.local/share/applications/goodvibes.desktop << 'EOF'
[Desktop Entry]
Name=GoodVibes
Comment=Enhanced Claude CLI Interface
Exec=$HOME/.local/bin/GoodVibes.AppImage --no-sandbox %U
Icon=goodvibes
Type=Application
Categories=Development;
StartupWMClass=GoodVibes
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/goodvibes;
EOF
```

**Note:** The `--no-sandbox` flag may be required on some Linux distributions when running AppImages. If GoodVibes launches without issues, you can omit this flag.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mgd34msu/goodvibes.sh.git
   cd goodvibes.sh
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

// ... etc
```

### Database

SQLite database with WAL mode for concurrent access. Tables include:
- `sessions` - Session metadata
